## Installation

```
npm install nexus-plugin-subscriptions
```

NOTE: You will probably need to use my forked version of `nexus` which allows the passing of a shared HTTP server: https://github.com/danielmahon/nexus/tree/support-custom-http-server

<br>

## Example Usage

This is a work in progress and most likely a temporary solution until subscriptions are natively supported by nexus.

See https://github.com/graphql-nexus/nexus/issues/447#issuecomment-630882390 for usage example
